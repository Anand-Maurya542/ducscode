# Constructors in `ContainerEvent` Class

## `ContainerEvent(Component src, int type, Component comp)`
It instantiates a `ContainerEvent` object. 

The first argument `src` is a reference to the `Component` object (container) that originated the event. This method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if `src` is null. The second argument `type` is an integer indicating the type of event. The third argument `comp` is the reference to the `Component` that was added or removed.

# Constructors in `FocusEvent` Class

## `FocusEvent(Component src, int type)`
It instantiates a `FocusEvent` object and identifies it as a permanent change in focus.

Here, the first argument `src` is the `Component` that originated the event. This method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if `src` is `null`. The second argument `type` is an integer indicating the type of event.

## `FocusEvent(Component src, int type, boolean temporaryFlag)`
It instantiates a `FocusEvent` object and identifies whether or not the change is temporary. 

Here, the first argument `src` is the `Component` that originated the event. This method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if `src` is `null`. The second argument `type` is an integer indicating the type of event. The third argument `temporaryFlag` is a boolean value which is set to `true` if the focus change is temporary and is `false` otherwise.

## `FocusEvent(Component src, int type, boolean temporaryFlag, Component other)`
It instantiates a `FocusEvent` object with the specified temporary state and opposite `Component`. The opposite `Component` is the `other` `Component` involved in this focus change. For a `FOCUS_GAINED` event, this is the `Component` that lost focus. For a `FOCUS_LOST` event, this is the `Component` that gained focus. If this focus change occurs with a native application, with a Java application in a different VM, or with no `other` `Component`, then the opposite `Component` is `null`. 

Here, the first argument `src` is the `Component` that originated the event. This method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if `src` is `null`. The second argument `type` is an integer indicating the type of event. The third argument `temporaryFlag` is a boolean value which is set to `true` if the focus change is temporary and is `false` otherwise. The fourth argument `other` is the opposite `Component` involved in the focus change, or `null`.
