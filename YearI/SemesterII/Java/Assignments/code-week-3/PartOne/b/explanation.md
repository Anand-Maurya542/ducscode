The output of the given program is `ACE`F.

The execution jumps into the `try` block and executes the first statement `System.out.print("A");` resulting in the first character out of the output being `A`.

An instance of `ArithmeticException` is thrown in the next line of code i.e. `int num = 99 / 0;` due to division by zero. The execution skips to the first `catch` block.

The type of the exception in the first `catch` block matches that of the exception thrown in the last executed line of code. Hence, code in the block is executed. Execution of `System.out.print("C");` results in the second character of the output being `C`. The execution skips to the `finally` block.

The execution of `System.out.print("E");` results in the penultimate character `E` in the output.

The execution of `System.out.print("F");` results in the final character `F` in the output.
